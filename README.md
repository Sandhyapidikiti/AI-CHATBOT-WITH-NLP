This project focuses on building a simple AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is developed in Python using NLP libraries like NLTK or 
spaCy. It is capable of understanding and responding to user queries based on pre-defined intents and patterns. The project demonstrates how NLP can be used to process and 
interpret human language, making it useful for applications such as virtual assistants, FAQ bots, and automated customer support systems.
